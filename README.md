## Guide

<!-- Javascript array methods are arrays forming a data structure containing list of elements which store multiple values in a single variable. The strength of JavaScript arrays lies in the array methods which are built-in functions we can apply to our arrays.  Each method has a unique function that performs a change or calculation to our array, saving having to write common functions from scratch. -->
